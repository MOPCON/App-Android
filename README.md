When a feature branch is finished, you must submit a **Pull Request** to develop branch.

Don't forget assign your partner to review it.

### App Version

The App Version use Semantic Versioning concept.

The Semantic Versioning concept is simple: all versions have 3 digits: x.y.z.

* the first digit is the major version
* the second digit is the minor version
* the third digit is the patch version

When you make a new release, you don’t just up a number as you please, but you have rules:

* up the major version when you make incompatible API changes 
* up the minor version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
* up the patch version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes

```
npm version [major|minor|patch] --no-git-tag-version
```
